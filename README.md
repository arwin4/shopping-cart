This is a shopping cart app for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart).

It uses the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/), although the API call is currently mocked.

This was my first time using the React Router. The project uses the React Context API as well as CSS Modules.
